# if you have comments in the ouput file first character must be #
# 
# appended at end of each input line will be:
# 	price   dv01   risk     LGD
#
# 	all will have 3 places of precision
#
#	LGD is amount adjusted (multiply LGD by Amount)
#
# Below are three lines with the correct outputs in the correct format
#
# For example, for the last line price is 45.289, dv01 is .089 and risk is 444.011.
# This means that for the position amount of 500000 ($50 million since units are in thousands),
# we will make $44,4011 for each basis point move down in yield (since we are long, if yields go down, price goes up)
